# Wave
Wave is a Python-based application that transforms a standard webcam into a virtual input device. By leveraging HSV color tracking and morphological processing, Wave allows users to control the mouse cursor and perform clicks simply by moving a colored object in the air, eliminating the need for physical contact.
